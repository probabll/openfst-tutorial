Here we gather a few notebooks to demonstrate how FSTs can be used to efficiently represent distributions over discrete sets. 
We can use standard FST operations implemented in the OpenFST library to constrain sample spaces, to prescribe a factorisation, a parameterisation, and to obtain quantities such as marginal probabilities and unbiased samples.

We use [openfst-python](https://pypi.org/project/openfst-python/), a python wrapper around the *excellent* [OpenFST library](http://www.openfst.org).
